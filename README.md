# Reflex Shooter Game
This repo contains sample Vibe code, which got generated by GitHub Copilot as part of a live class. From Agent Mode, I shared the following story:

```
as a kid, I played arcade games a lot. I want to build a Python app, which tests me on my shooting reflexes. Help me developing a game which does the following:

1. aks for player name input
2. bottom middle of the game screen shows a shooter 
3. anywhere random on screen appears a target
4. player uses the space bar to simulate a shoot
5. calculate the time between the target appearing and player pressing the space bar to shoot
6. if that time is less than 0.3 sec, player wins, otherwise computer wins
7. show a "YOU WIN" or "YOU ARE TOO SLOW" dpeending on the outcome 
```

in less than 5 minutes, it generated a workable version of the game, fixing the necessary hiccups, knowing I was running all this from within GitHub Codespaces. (Little hint if you are curious... Codespaces is terminal-mode only, not a GUI to run games.)

If you want to replicate this scenario, open GitHub Copilot Agent Mode on your development environment, paste in the story, grab a coffee, acknowledge a few steps and enjoy gaming in less than 5 minutes!
